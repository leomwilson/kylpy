# Kylpy

Kylpy is an iOS app that helps university students locate open bathrooms on campus, particularly at night. The app was developed in Swift and uses a [custom backend](https://gitlab.com/lwilson/kylpy-server). I submitted this as my final project for CSE335: Introduction to Mobile Application Development at Arizona State University.

I created this repository after the course ended. This was initially developed in November 2023.
